## Here's a basic architectural diagram:

[Client Devices]
        |
        v
[Application Load Balancer]
        |
        v
[ECS Cluster]
    |       |
    v       v
[Task 1]  [Task 2]  ... (Fargate or EC2)
    |       |
    |       |
    v       v
[RDS PostgreSQL Database]
        |
        v
[AWS Secrets Manager / Parameter Store]



## Key components:

Client Devices: Web browsers or API clients that interact with your application.
Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple ECS tasks.
ECS Cluster: Manages the containerized Flask application.

Tasks: Run your Flask application containers (using Fargate or EC2).


RDS PostgreSQL Database: Stores user data and other application information.
AWS Secrets Manager / Parameter Store: Securely stores database credentials and other configuration.

Additional components you might consider:

Amazon CloudWatch: For logging and monitoring.
Amazon ECR: To store your Docker images.
VPC with public and private subnets: For network isolation and security.

## Data flow:

Clients send requests to the ALB.
ALB forwards requests to healthy ECS tasks.
ECS tasks process requests, interacting with the RDS database as needed.
ECS tasks retrieve secrets from Secrets Manager/Parameter Store for database access.
Responses are sent back through the ALB to the clients.
